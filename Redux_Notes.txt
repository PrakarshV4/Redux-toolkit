Redux

What is redux?
- Redux is an open source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state.

- <App/> ------> <Home/>----------> <Post/>
  . Suppose you created a state c in <App/> and want to use it in <Post/> then u can send it by props. But if you created a state c in <Post/> and want to use it in <App/> or in <Home/> then it is not possible as React allows unidirectional flow of data. 
  
  Here comes the use of react.

  We create a store where we keep the variables in another file and use the stored variables across all components.

-Terminologies for  Redux 
    1. Store - where all our variables and data are kept
    2. Reducer - the only way using which we can change the state of the data in store
    3. Action - trigger point of gun. If gun is reducer then action is the trigger. On action the reducer is activated.
    4. State
